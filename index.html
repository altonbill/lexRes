<h4>Profile</h4>
<p>I have recently earned my degree and am so excited to enter the field of teaching and continue my pedagogical development! I have been honored to work with a variety of talented individuals and have learned a lot from the steps through USU’s TEAL program. I have thoroughly enjoyed watching students develop as learners and as individuals – and I hope to get the privilege to continue to advocate for their voices and play a role in their education.
I belief heavily in the impact of discussion based, student led learning and hope to facilitate a healthy environment for students to explore their thoughts and reasoning.
